On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment

Current Usage:
./MIPSsim inputfilename outputfilename

The other arguments seems belongs to PartII, thus not implemented yet.

Notes:
1: I am not very sure about the .data section, thus my solution is based on the assumption that it was following BREAK immediately.
2: The codes were tested under CISE thunder server.
