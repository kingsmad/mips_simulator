On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment

Current Usage:
./MIPSsim inputfilename outputfilename -Tn:m

For example, ./MIPSsim fibonacci_bin.bin sim_output.txt

About -Tn:m option:
    n and m stands for the cycles started from n to m in trace.
    However, if n == 0 && m == 0, only the last cycle will be printed.

Notes:
1: The codes were tested under CISE thunder server and passed for Thursday's sample
   version (Latest by now - Nov.28)
2: I noticed that in the sample, TA used windows machine which produced <CR> instead of 
   <LF>. However, my trace used <LF> which might cause diff command to fail on every   
   line. In this case, I will be greatly appreciated if TA could use vimdiff to compare
   the traces.
3: As mentioned in clarification, I omitted sim/dis option.
4: I assume that all the memory addresses are in the range of input.
5: I assume that the input file size is less than 10M
